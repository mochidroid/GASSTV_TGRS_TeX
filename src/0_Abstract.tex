	We propose a novel regularization function, Graph-Aided Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (GASSTV), for hyperspectral (HS) image denoising. Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV), defined using second-order spatio-spectral differences, is a widely used regularization approach that effectively captures the spatio-spectral piecewise smoothness specific to HS images, enabling robust noise removal. However, SSTV uniformly computes adjacent differences in spatial and spectral dimensions, leading to the corruption of complex spatial structures and abrupt spectral variations in HS images. To address these limitations, we incorporate spatial and spectral graphs that explicitly reflect the spatial and spectral structures into the regularization model. Furthermore, we design a framework to construct these graphs from the noisy HS image. In addition, we formulate the mixed noise removal problem as a convex optimization problem involving GASSTV and develop an efficient algorithm based on the preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve it. Experimental results on mixed noise removal demonstrate the superior performance of GASSTV compared with existing HS image regularization models.
