\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed a new regularization method, named $\SSSTTV$, for denoising and destriping of HS images. $\SSSTTV$ is defined as the sum of the nuclear norms of matrices consisting of second-order spatio-spectral differences in small spectral blocks, which fully captures the spatial piecewise-smoothness, the spatial similarity between adjacent bands, and the spectral correlation across all bands of HS images. We have formulated the denoising and destriping problem as a constrained convex optimization problem including $\SSSTTV$, and developed the optimization algorithm based on P-PDS. Experiments on HS images with simulated or real noise have demonstrated the superiority of $\SSSTTV$ over existing methods. For future work, we will improve the implementation of the proposed method by accelerating the SVD computations using distributed computing techniques and fast algorithms.
