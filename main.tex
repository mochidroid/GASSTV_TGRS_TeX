% Use $\backslash${\tt{appendix}} if you have a single appendix:
% Do not use $\backslash${\tt{section}} anymore after $\backslash${\tt{appendix}}, only $\backslash${\tt{section*}}.
% If you have multiple appendixes use $\backslash${\tt{appendices}} then use $\backslash${\tt{section}} to start each appendix.
% You must declare a $\backslash${\tt{section}} before using any $\backslash${\tt{subsection}} or using $\backslash${\tt{label}} ($\backslash${\tt{appendices}} by itself
%  starts a section numbered zero.)}

% \section{Biography Section}
% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
%  needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
%  the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
%  $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
%  your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
%  simpler here.)

% Use the author name as the 3rd argument followed by the biography text.
